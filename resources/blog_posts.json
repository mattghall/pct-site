I'm guessing they assumed someone left them behind and thought they were being helpful by bringing them to a trailhead. I ran into some course markers for the Mountain Lakes 100 and they said they'll bring the poles to the start line at Ollallie Lake Saturday if they find them at a trailhead or someone with a suspicious extra pair of poles. Annoying, but hopefully won't need them until I see Kjersti Saturday.\nPM Update: pretty good day other than the poles.
